"""Common contract for algorithms exposed by the Slime training backend.

Subclass :class:`SlimeAlgorithm`, set the class attributes, implement the
abstract method, and decorate the class with ``@register_loss_family`` so
importing the package registers it::

    @register_loss_family
    class MyAlgo(SlimeAlgorithm):
        loss_family = "my-algo"
        loss_type = "custom_loss"

        def validate_specific_args(self, args, source):
            ...

Pipeline stages (each a method on the class; defaults are no-ops or shared
implementations — override only what your algorithm needs):

    1. **configure**  — ``parse_specific_options`` / ``apply_driver_options`` /
       ``validate_specific_args``: CLI parsing and backend-arg validation.
    2. **shape row**   — ``shape_sample_row``: per-sample wire-row serialization.
    3. **build batch** — ``build_rollout_data``: wire rows → Slime batch dict.
    4. **prepare**     — ``prepare_rollout``: pre-training work (teacher scoring,
       advantage hooks, etc.) on the bridge actor.
    5. **compute loss** — registered via ``@objective`` in ``objective.py``
       (worker-side, resolved by :func:`resolve_objective_paths`). Two lanes:
       a family either replaces Slime's whole loss (``loss_type =
       "custom_loss"`` + a ``custom_loss_function_path`` hook) or keeps
       Slime's stock ``policy_loss`` and swaps only the per-token pg
       primitive (``uses_pg_loss_primitive = True`` + a
       ``custom_pg_loss_function_path`` hook; the adapter layer routes
       Slime's CISPO callsite onto the registered primitive). Two further
       worker lifecycle channels exist: ``reef_actor_init_hook_path`` runs
       once at actor init and ``reef_actor_pre_train_hook_path`` before each
       train step, for families that keep state on the actor (a frozen
       teacher, for one).
    6. **train step**  — ``train``: critic→actor orchestration on the bridge
       actor; ``rollout_metrics`` for telemetry.

Stages 1-4 and 6 run in the driver process.  Stage 5 runs in Megatron workers
that only receive a serialized ``args`` Namespace.  The driver stamps
``args.loss_family``; the worker calls :func:`resolve_objective_paths` during
init to import the algorithm's ``objective.py`` (triggering ``@objective``
decorators) and project the dotted paths onto ``args``.
``bind()`` returns a runtime-bound instance (``self`` for stateless algorithms;
override to carry per-run state such as a teacher client or a train schedule).

Adding a family
---------------

A family lives in its method package beside its objective hooks:

    my_method/slime/
      __init__.py     the spec: a SlimeAlgorithm subclass, no torch
      objective.py    the @objective hooks, torch (worker side)
      <concern>.py    further worker-side torch modules, imported only from
                      objective.py's hooks (e.g. a Megatron teacher)
      utils/          driver-side helpers, never importing torch; only when
                      the family's wire row is not the default five columns

Register each declared hook with ``@objective`` so the worker resolves and
validates it at init time::

    @objective("custom_loss_function_path")
    def my_loss(args, batch, logits, sum_of_sample_mean): ...

Register the spec by reference from the package ``__init__`` —
``register_loss_family_ref("<name>", "my_method.slime:MyMethodAlgorithm")``
(:mod:`reef.train.algos.registry`) — so the service never imports
the Slime side and the driver imports it on first resolve. Naming conventions, enforced by
``tests/reef_service/test_slime_algorithm_contract.py``: the spec class is
``<Pkg>Algorithm`` and its driver options ``<Pkg>Settings``, both importable
from the family package root; ``@objective`` entry points are ``<pkg>_loss``,
``<pkg>_advantages``, ``<pkg>_actor_init`` / ``<pkg>_actor_pre_train``; family
CLI flags are ``--<pkg>-*``.
