"""Stream single rollouts of many problems through Reef, N in flight, the paper's way.

SAO (arXiv:2607.07508, §4.1) trains with a batch of 128 rollouts and a group
size of 1: every rollout in a step comes from a different prompt, and a rollout
joins the next step the moment it is scored, without waiting for siblings. The
Harbor loop in ``run.py`` is the smallest possible instance of that (six
rollouts of one problem, one optimizer step each) and is meant as a smoke
test. This driver is the paper's shape at a budget one node can afford: it
keeps ``IN_FLIGHT`` requests open at all times, each on a problem drawn from a
training pool, grades each completion with the same strict rule the Harbor
verifier uses, and reports the score against that rollout's receipt. Reef
trains whenever ``recipe.config.batch-size`` reports have accumulated.

Problems come from a JSONL file with ``problem_idx``, ``problem`` and ``gold``
columns (``export_problems.py`` writes it from the Hugging Face dump). The
held-out indices are never served, so a later evaluation on them measures
generalization rather than memorization.

Environment:
  SAO_PROBLEMS      path to the problems JSONL (required)
  SAO_HOLDOUT       comma-separated problem_idx values to exclude (default: none)
  SAO_POOL          optional comma-separated problem_idx values to train on
  SAO_IN_FLIGHT     concurrent rollouts (default 8; the paper-shaped runs keep at
                    least the recipe batch size in flight)
  SAO_BUDGET        total scored rollouts before the driver stops (default 320)
  SAO_MAX_TOKENS    generation window per rollout (default 61440)
  SAO_RECORDS_PATH  where one JSON line per scored rollout is appended
  SAO_SEED          sampling seed for the problem order (default 0)
  SAO_BATCH         rollouts per optimizer step (the recipe's batch-size); the
                    driver waits for BUDGET // SAO_BATCH training releases
                    before exiting, so the stack is not torn down mid-step
  SAO_TRAIN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_S  how long to wait for that drain (default 14400)
  SAO_PROGRESS_FILE  optional file holding the number of optimizer steps done
                    (written by whoever can see the trainer's checkpoints); with
                    it the driver keeps at most SAO_AHEAD batches (default 3)
                    generated beyond the trained ones, so engines do not run
                    far ahead of a slower trainer and pile up stale rollouts
  SAO_STALL_S       seconds without trainer progress before the pacer releases
                    one extra batch (default 2700). Must exceed the step time,
                    or the pacer releases batches the trainer will drop as stale
